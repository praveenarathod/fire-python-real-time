Real-time violence detection using deep learning is a computer vision system that automatically identifies violent actions (like fights or assaults) from live video feeds, such as CCTV footage. It uses deep learning models—typically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or 3D CNNs—to analyze spatial and temporal features from video frames. These models are trained on datasets containing violent and non-violent scenes, allowing the system to accurately detect and alert security personnel when violent behavior is recognized, enhancing public safety and reducing response time.
